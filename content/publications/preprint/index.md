abstract: From a sample of more than 70 countries, we examine the effect of household heterogeneity on monetary policy shocks. We find that, when there is a U.S. monetary policy shock, household inequality matter for response of industrial production and interest rate, while doesnâ€™t matter for response of exchange rate, export and import. This indicates that the demand spillovers from monetary shocks increase with heterogeneity within the country, but the terms of trade and real exchange rate effects remain relatively unaffected.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Countries with higher Gini index have stronger response to U.S. monetary policy shocks in interest rate and production.
